# ECG-Arrhythmia-Analyzer based on my final year project in college.

1.The ECG Analyzer is able to calculate the heart rate of a digitized ECG signal


2. The digitized ECG signal used in this project can be downloaded from the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database 

3. The basic workflow of the analyzer is; Signal acquisition and pre-processing -> Signal filtering and baseline noise-removal -> Feature extraction(heart rate, PQRST wave exrtaction and statistical property extraction) -> Neural Network training -> Classification

4. To use the analyzer, install MATLAB on your machine and run the ECG_GUI.fig file.

5. The entry-point to the program is analyzeECG.m

6. The paper written based of off this project can be located at; https://www.researchgate.net/publication/334455337_Design_and_Simulation_of_Electrocardiogram_Circuit_with_Automatic_Analysis_of_ECG_Signal
